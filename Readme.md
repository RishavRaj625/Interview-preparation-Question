1. Self intro

Good morning Sir,
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.

My name is Rishav Raj, and I’m a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Business Systems at Techno Main Salt Lake.

I’m passionate about Web Development, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics, and I’ve developed several projects using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, FastApi, Flask, and MySQL.
Recently, I was a finalist in the IIIT Kalyani hackathon, where my team built Health@stic — a smart healthcare website designed for students and bachelors to manage their health more easily.

Later, in 2024, I participated in a national-level hackathon at NIT Raipur, where our team was selected among the top 40 out of 800 teams, and we were thrilled to win the competition.

These experiences helped me improve my teamwork, problem-solving, and presentation skills, and taught me how to turn ideas into working solutions under pressure.

Apart from academics, I enjoy dancing, playing badminton, and listening to music to relax my mind.

I consider myself a quick learner, a team player, and someone who genuinely enjoys using technology to solve real-world problems.
My goal is to grow as a professional in a reputed organization like ITC Infotech, contributing to impactful projects and learning continuously.

Thank you once again for this opportunity.

2. Strengths and Weaknesses 

One of my key strengths is that I’m a quick learner and adapt easily to new technologies.
I enjoy learning new tools and applying them to solve real problems.

I’m also a team player during hackathons and college projects, I’ve learned how to work together, manage time, and share ideas effectively.
Another strength is my consistency and positive attitude, even when things don’t go as planned.

Talking about my weakness — I sometimes try to make everything perfect, which can take extra time.
But I’ve been improving this by setting deadlines and focusing more on progress than perfection.

Overall, I believe my strengths help me grow continuously, and I’m turning my weaknesses into learning opportunities every day.
